# House-Price-Prediction
Project Overview: 
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes multiple attributes related to house characteristics, such as size, location, and amenities, which are used to build a predictive model.

Key Components:

Data Collection:

The dataset used for this project typically includes features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, and other relevant characteristics of the houses.
The dataset is sourced from public repositories or real estate databases and is often provided in CSV format.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: 
Strategies like imputation or removal are used to address missing values in the dataset.

Feature Engineering:
New features are created or existing ones are transformed to improve the predictive power of the model. For example, combining features or encoding categorical variables.

Normalization/Standardization: 
Features are scaled to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics:
Calculation of summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand the distribution of data.

Data Visualization:
Use of visual tools like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between features.
Model Building:

Various regression algorithms are applied to predict house prices. 
Common models include:
Linear Regression: A fundamental approach for predicting continuous values.
Decision Trees: A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values to make predictions.
Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: A boosting technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Techniques such as cross-validation, mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared are used to assess model performance and accuracy.

Model Tuning:

Hyperparameter optimization is performed to fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
Techniques like Grid Search or Random Search may be used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
Results and Insights:

The project includes an analysis of the modelâ€™s performance and the insights derived from the predictions.
Important features impacting house prices are identified, and visualizations are created to illustrate the findings.
Deployment (Optional):

The predictive model may be deployed as a web application or API for real-time price predictions.
Technical Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Data Source: Publicly available datasets or real estate databases


Objective: 

The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model for house prices that can assist real estate professionals and potential buyers in making informed decisions based on various house attributes.
